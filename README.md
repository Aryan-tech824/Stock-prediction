# Stock-prediction
I devised a LSTM Recurrent Neural Network model to predict for the stock price of google for the year 2017. We first train the RNN on training set data then applied on the test set data. The graph of the predicted values and actual values is also plotted for clarification regarding the accuracy of the model.
